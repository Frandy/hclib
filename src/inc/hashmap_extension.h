 * Avoiding deadlock when attempting isolation on multiple objects  
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Prior art: "A data-centric approach to synchronization"
 *             http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2160913
 *
 * As described in above paper, we assign unique index to each object
 * that has registered for enabling isolation. We maintain only one
 * hashmap of these objects (as keys) in hclib during the entire execution.
 * Whenever object(s) request enabling isolation, a lock is acquired on the hashmap
 * before attempting to create a bucket for this key-value pair in hashmap.
 * Every time an entry is pushed to hashmap, the entry is assigned the current
 * value of mutex_lock_index and then mutex_lock_index is incremented. Hashmap 
 * lock is release once the object(s) are added to the hashmap.
 *
 * User is allowed to pass multiple objects for isolation:
 *      hclib::isolation(obj1, obj2, obj3, ..., objN, atomic_operation_lambda);
 *
 * The above code can lead to deadlock: Suppose thread T1 requests isolation of obj1 and then obj2; 
 * and thread T2 requests isolation on obj2 and then obj1. T1 locks obj1 and T2 locks obj2. Now
 * T1 will try to lock obj2 and T2 will try to lock obj1, leading to a deadlock.
 *
 * To avoid situations like above, we assign (as in above paper) 
 * each object an unique index (mutex_lock_index).
 * Hence, in above situation, both T1 and T2 would first check the index of obj1 and obj2.
 * Assuming index_obj1 < index_obj2, both T1 and T2 would first attempt lock on obj1
 * followed by obj2. This will avoid the deadlock described above.
